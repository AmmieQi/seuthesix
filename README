This project provides a LaTeX document class: ``seuthesix''
for typesetting thesis of Southeast University, Nanjing, China.
This package provides three important files:
1. the seuthesix.cls.
2. the seuthesix.cfg, this is the configuration file of seuthesix and
will be loaded by seuthesix.cls at runtime. This file must be in the same directory as
seuthesix.cls.
3. the seuthesix.bst, this is the accompanying bibliography style file
for seuthesix.cls.

Subdirectories: /doc and /examples provide documentation and examples of this package.
